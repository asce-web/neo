  Highlighted Content Blocks, commonly referred to as callouts,
  are modular blocks of content movable anywhere on a page. They
  might contain a heading, some content, and one or more action buttons.
  Typically, the heading is given an #[code.docs-code id] to be used as
  a fragment identifier (internal page anchors).
