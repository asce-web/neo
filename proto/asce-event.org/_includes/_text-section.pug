    h2 Hotel Information
    p.
      The reservation deadline for the hotel is
      #[time.c-Date(datetime="2016-01-14") Thursday, January 14, 2016] however rooms are
      selling out, so make sure you read this very long paragraph which probably
      no one will read because studies show that users of the web merely skim through
      the page to find the information most relavent to them in the fastest
      way possible.
    p(itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place")
      span(itemprop="name") Sheraton Phoenix Downtown Hotel

      span(itemprop="name") Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)

      br
      a(href="" itemprop="telephone") 602-273-3300
    p.
      PHX is located #[del approximately]#[ins about] 6 miles from the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown Hotel
      and Phoenix Convention Center and no one will actually read this paragraph
      because they will probably just Google map it themselves.
    h3 Shuttle
    p.
      SuperShuttle Servidce costs approximately (again with the long words)
      $26 for a round-trip ride from the airport to the hotel then back to the airport,
      which is overly redundant for a web page.
    h2 Taxi Service
    p About $25 one-way from airport to hotel. See, that wasn&rsquo;t so bad, was it?
